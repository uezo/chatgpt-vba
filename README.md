# chatgpt-vba
ChatGPT API Client for VBA.

# ‚ú® Features

- Pure VBA: Run anywhere where VBA runs without any installations.

# üöÄ Quick start

1. Set reference to Microsoft Scripting Runtime.
1. Add ChatGPT.bas and JsonConverter.bas to your VBA Project.
    - https://github.com/uezo/chatgpt-vba/releases
1. Make your script and run.

```vb
Sub Main()
    ChatGPT.ApiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"
    Debug.Print ChatGPT.Chat("What is the difference between a dolphin and a whale?")
End Sub
```

Or, use `GetCompletion()` to call API with other parameters.

```vb
Sub Main()
    ChatGPT.ApiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"

    Dim messages() As Dictionary
    messages = ChatGPT.CreateMessages("You are biologist.", "What is the difference between a dolphin and a whale?")
    
    Dim completion As String
    completion = ChatGPT.GetCompletion(messages, maxTokens:=1000, temperature:=0.5)
    
    Debug.Print completion
End Sub
```
